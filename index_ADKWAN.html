<p>Featured Photo + Headline & Gallery</p>
<p>1) BRAND: clean, neat, modern, light</p>
<p>2) FUNCTIONALITY: Functional, because it highlights the author as a designer, with the portfolio easily accessible and directly underneath a graphic that shows obvious skill in design coding.</p>
<p>3) INTERACTIVITY: Great interactivity throughout the site, from the featured photo graphic animation to the right side navigation bar.</p>
<p>4) NAVIGATION: Main navigation on the right side is effective, efficient, and beautiful. Sites the author designed are a click away in the portfolio grid section.</p>

<p>Headline & Gallery</p>
<p>1) BRAND: clean, professional, technical</p>
<p>2) FUNCTIONALITY: Functional, because the main top header is very effective in what it does in promoting the brand as well as acting as a navigation toolbar.</p>
<p>3) INTERACTIVITY: Limited interactivity, but this allows for special features to pop out during mouseovers.</p>
<p>4) NAVIGATION: Navigation is very good as the main top header virtually remains unchanged when browsing throughout the site. Sites the author designed are a click away in the gallery section.</p>

<p>2) FUNCTIONALITY: Functional in drawing attention and interest to the site. Fun to browse around, and makes user want to stay and explore entire site.</p>
<p>3) INTERACTIVITY: Lots of interactivity as it is a playful site. Vertical type of cover flow that interacts with the scroll wheel gets the user involved.</p>
<p>4) NAVIGATION: Navigation is very easy to use as the majority of items on the site pop out without a refresh of the entire page, allowing zero loss of current place in previous page. Clicking in background to access background pages is very usable.</p>

<p>Featured Graphic</p>
<p>1) BRAND: neat, professional, technical</p>
<p>2) FUNCTIONALITY: Very functional as a professional site. Clients are drawn to the site in trust that the author will do a professional job. Past designs are highlighted and featured in the main graphic.</p>
<p>3) INTERACTIVITY: Two left and right arrows dictate the main interactivity of the site, which is very effective in showing off the work of the author as a designer. The transition animations are very smooth and appealing aesthetically. </p>
<p>4) NAVIGATION: Only two major links at the top are deemed necessary in representing the author as a designer. Other navigation of the previous work of the author is found at the click of a button on the left and right arrows, while the main information, signature, and logo remain stationary throughout the browsing experience.</p>

<p>Featured Photo</p>
<p>1) BRAND: simple, professional, sophisticated</p>
<p>2) FUNCTIONALITY: Functional in keeping photography as the main point of focus, especially with the main object box, which doubles as a slideshow of most prized photos.</p>
<p>3) INTERACTIVITY: Main interactivity is in the slideshow of photos, which does a beautiful job of letting the user feel into the photo as he/she clicks through them. Large, featured photo slideshow allows user to experience the moment, as photography is popularly desired to do.</p>
<p>4) NAVIGATION: Navigation is effective in both the main page and the inside pages. The main page effectively promotes the author as a photographer. More so in the inside pages, there is a stable navigation bar at the top of the site that provides links to other parts of the site.</p>

<p>4) NAVIGATION: Top navigation bar is very good, as it contains pop-down menus that appear during mouseover, effectively leading to the multiple branches of the brand in the site. The smooth pop-down animations in the toolbar create an almost flawless journey throughout the site.</p>
